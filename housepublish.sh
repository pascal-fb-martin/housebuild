# HousePublish: install all listed debian package to the local repository.
#
# This script was meant for creating a private apt repository,
# not a repository published on the Internet. Even while this
# repository is signed (and the key is kept private), there
# was no security audit of the publising method below. Use caution.
#
# This is a rather primitive and clumsy use of aptly. The goal here
# is not to manage or maintain apt repositories using aptly, only
# to use aptly as a tool to generate a repository.
#
# NOTE:
# On the apt client side, set the apt source (.list) file as follow:
#   deb http://<host>/debian bookworm main
# and copy http://<host>/debian/house.asc to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d

# The distribution name is part of the root path to support multiple ones.
# I do realize that aptly can generate repository with multiple distributions,
# but the mechanisms to select which packages go where remain obscure to me.
# The goal here is very limited: facilitate the transition during upgrades
# by not destroying the existing repository right away. The development
# machines would upgrade first: while testing the upgrade the not-yet
# upgraded machines can still access an appropriate repository.
